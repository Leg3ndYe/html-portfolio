<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a self-taught developer who loves BBQ and Motorcycles.</p>

<p>Since I was a little kid, I have always wanted to become a developer. There was never enough time 
  (or that is atleast what I kept telling myself all these past years). There were times when I started
  a journey, I had been learning back-end developing with .NET, C# but it was not something that made me
  filled with joy. So on 05/24/2024 I started a journey like no other. I began learning fron-end developing.
</p>

<p>I had found a course by this amazing mentor Angela Yu, she is currently teaching me HTML and this
  is the final project in HTML section. I am so greatful to her since this really does make me filled with
  joy and happines. I can finally create something and be proud of how it looks.
</p>

<p>In the next section we will be learning about CSS, so after I do that, after I become
  good in CSS, I will come back and I will make this look so much nicer. I am so hyped about it and I can not 
  wait to get good at it!
